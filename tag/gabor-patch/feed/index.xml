<p>As said in the title, participants with corrected vision (wearing glass or contact lens) may still have distorted vision due to whatever reason, especially in Gabor patch detection task.</p>



<p>This question comes from my personal experience, I always feel that the vertical Gabor patch is brighter than horizontal ones, and is easier to detect. Below is my test data from 800 trials of a detection task (error bar represents 1 SE).</p>



<p>I gradually increased the Gabor patch contrast from 0 to 100%, I pressed a button when I saw something on the screen (grey background).</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://jianchen.info/images/gabor/CJ04May17a.png" alt=""><br>Session 1</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://jianchen.info/images/gabor/CJ04May17b.png" alt=""><br>Session 2</p>



<p>I am quite curious about why I feel so differently for these two kinds of Gabor patch, am I special? Do I have something wrong with my eye?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>So I asked two colleague (they don’t wear glass regularly) to do the same task, and it turns out no difference between vertical and horizontal Gabor patches.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://jianchen.info/images/gabor/CV04May17a.png" alt=""><br>Colleague 1</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://jianchen.info/images/gabor/JN06May17a.png" alt=""><br>Colleague 2</p>



<p>Then what’s going on underneath?</p>



<p>I doubt that although I have a glass to correct my vision, I may not have astigmatism corrected. So I asked a friend, who also wear a glass, to do the same task. As you can see, he has the same problem.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://jianchen.info/images/gabor/ZL28Jun17a.png" alt=""><br>Friend 1</p>



<p>Insofar, my guess of the explanation for such results is astigmatism. Me and my friend both have inappropriately corrected vision, which leads to the difference in detection task.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>You may have a quick test to see if you have astigmatism. All the bars in below should have similar brightness.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://jianchen.info/images/gabor/EYE_astigmatism.gif" alt=""><br>Astigmatism Test</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>What’s the hint from this observation? Well, it may remind us to make sure that participants who claim a correctly corrected vision should be re-checked, especially in those vision tasks relying on Gabor patch detection.</p>
